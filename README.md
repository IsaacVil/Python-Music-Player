# Music Player Made in Python

## About the Project  
The **Music Player** is a desktop application developed as part of the **Taller de Programaci√≥n** course at the **Technological Institute of Costa Rica (TEC)**. This project utilizes **Python** and **Tkinter** to create a simple music player that allows users to manage and play their music library. The application enables users to organize songs, artists, albums, genres, and playlists, and includes functionality for managing user roles like owners and admins.

The primary goal of this project is to practice basic programming concepts such as **data management** and **GUI development** using **Tkinter**. The music player provides a simple yet effective interface for organizing and playing music.  
  
The project was a collaborative effort between **Isaac Villalobos** and **Kevin Vega**, showcasing our ability to build interactive and functional systems with long-term data storage.  
Any doubts or questions of the inner workings of the project can be made to my personal email: **IsaacVillalobosB@gmail.com**.  
## Features
- **Music Management**:
  - **Add/Remove Songs**: Users can add new songs to the library or remove existing ones.
  - **Artist Management**: Manage artists and link their songs to their profiles.
  - **Album Management**: Organize songs by album and manage album details.
  - **Genre Management**: Categorize songs into different genres for easy navigation.
  - **Playlist Management**: Create and manage personalized playlists.
  
- **User Roles**:
  - **Admin**: Admins have full access to manage the entire music library, including adding/removing songs, artists, albums, and genres.
  - **Owner**: Owners can manage their personal library and playlists, with some restrictions compared to admins.

- **Music Playback**:
  - **Play/Pause**: Users can start and stop music playback.
  - **Next/Previous Track**: Navigate between tracks in a playlist.
  - **Volume Control**: Adjust the playback volume.
  - **Track Progress**: See the current progress of the song and jump to different parts of it.

- **User Interface**:
  - The application features a **Tkinter**-based GUI that is simple and user-friendly.
  - It displays metadata for songs, such as title, artist, album, and genre.
  - Users can easily navigate between playlists, albums, and genres.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **GUI Library**: Tkinter  
- **Audio Playback**: [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)
- **Data Management**: .Txt's
- **Version Control**: GitHub  

## Installation and Usage  
1) Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/IsaacVil/Python-Music-Player.git  
2) Open the project in **Python Idle**.  
3) Build and run the project to launch the music player.  

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, We:  
- Gained experience with **Tkinter** to build simple GUI applications in Python.
- Applied **data management** concepts to manage music-related data like songs, artists, albums, and playlists.
- Learned how to handle **audio playback** in Python, enhancing my understanding of multimedia integration in software.
- Developed skills in **data management** and organization, using Python to create an organized music library.

## Acknowledgments
- We would like to thank our **professor and classmates** at **TEC** for their guidance and support throughout the development of this project.
